step 1   Install Python3 and matplotlib

step 2   RSA scheme - receiver_rsa.py acts as server
                                     Blind_rsa.py acts as client

step 3   Elgamal scheme - Bank_server.py acts as server
                                           Alice_clinet.py acts as client


step 4   When you are going to compare both scheme using file samples. First delete chaum.txt and proposed.txt.

If you go with file input option , run RSA scheme and ElGamal scheme both for sample1,sample2,sample3,sample4 
and sample5 respectively and compare both scheme for these samples. It will again create chaum.txt and proposed.txt
which contain execution time for each samples.

chaum.txt - contains execution time for each samples (based on RSA scheme)
proposed.txt - contains execution time for each samples (based on Elgamal scheme)

Do not change the sequence of samples for the both scheme.

step 5  run compare.py
